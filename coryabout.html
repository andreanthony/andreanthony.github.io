<p><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;"><strong>5. Our Refund Policy.</strong> We hold a very sensible ‘Do The Work’ Refund policy which basically means you have to prove you’ve gone through the entire core curriculum, complete all the required work, answer a few questions which we’ll ask you once you can prove to us that you’ve done the work and then we’ll have the unilateral discretion to grant a refund. If you want a refund, contact us <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none">within 60 days of purchasing the course, </span>and prove you’ve done the whole core curriculum and we’ll send some follow up questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;">If you decide your purchase was not the right decision for you or your business, please contact our support team at </span><a href="mailto:support@vanessalau.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@vanessalau.co</a><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;"> within 60 days of enrollment. You must include your coursework with your request for a refund. If you request a refund and do not include your coursework by the 60th day, you will not be granted a refund. All refunds are discretionary as determined by Vanessa Lau International Inc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;">We are about honesty, fairness and customer satisfaction and have no problem issuing a full refund if you’ve actually tried your best and done the work but the course was not fitting for your business and/or business goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Red Hat Display&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.1 An example of a situation where we wouldn’t give a refund is if someone doesn’t put in any effort, doesn’t try at our courses, doesn’t take full responsibility for their own success and then asks for their money back. We also do not offer refunds for the following: (1) attempts to use the refund policy as a way to opt-out of any existing financial obligation and/or payment plan already committed to us upon signing up for our program, (2) change of business direction after purchasing the course, and/or (3) inability to complete the program within the 12 month access period.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.2. An example of a situation where we would give a refund is if you do the entire course, tried your best, share with us what you learned and then give an objectively fair reason why you want your money back. This means we are expecting the following documents and tasks to be completed:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;"><i>Disclaimer:</i> </span><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;">Due to the digital nature of our course, we do not offer refunds for those who do not do their due diligence to ensure the course is the right fit for them. It is the customers responsibility to review our sales page and terms and conditions carefully prior to purchase, use or access to any of our products and online courses. BGA is a program that is designed to help coaches get their first paid 1:1 clients with Instagram. The goal of the program has always been communicated in our marketing, such as our webinars, social media, and sales pages that the target audience for this program is new and aspiring coaches.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Red Hat Display&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Please note, our exclusive bonuses are non-refundable under any circumstances.</span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">6. Being Blacklisted.</strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"> Vanessa Lau retains the right to ‘Blacklist’ you from accessing any and all materials, courses or other products or services she offers in the event that you do not pay your bills or if you steal any of our intellectual property. You will be taken off the&nbsp; blacklist once you pay your full amount owing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;"><strong>7. Payment Plans.</strong> You will have two options of payment plans with Vanessa Lau. You can either pay up-front in full or you can pay in monthly installments. Please note that for monthly payments, Stripe will automatically deduct the amount from the account information you provide Stripe. In the event the payment fails, you will not be able to access any of the information or content sold through our Site or any other of our courses, products or services. In the event of three failed payments, you understand Vanessa Lau may contract a collection agency to collect the money from you. Please note a payment plan is not a membership, in which you cannot cancel at any time. By signing up for our payment plan, you agree to pay the balance owing of your payment plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;"><strong>8. <b>Breaking Payment Plans + Discontinued Payments.</b></strong> In the event that you break your agreed upon payment plan ($297/month for four months), our team will permit a three month grace period and will actively work with you to get payments back on track. <span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;">However, after three months of delinquent payments, you will be charged 10% per month ($29.70) for every month thereafter, that you either pause or discontinue your payment plan for up to one year. The 10% late fee will only commence after your initial three month grace period.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;">For example: If you have paid the first three months but then pause your payment plan for the fourth month and fail to get back on track after three months, you will owe $29.70 for EACH month (up to one year) that your account sits inactive. You will have to pay this amount before you can re-access your account. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;"><strong>9. Course Access.</strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;">&nbsp;Your 12-month access to our program and private community will activate immediately upon purchasing the program. We have designed our course to be completed in as soon as 60-90 days, which is why we have factored in 10 additional months to account for differing schedules, learning preferences, speeds, and students who may need to take a break due to</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Red Hat Display&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;unforeseen circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Red Hat Display&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">10. No Guarantees.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Red Hat Display&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;We make NO GUARANTEES about any success that you’ll get from our Site or our courses or any of our free offers. We will do everything for you to succeed, but we make no guarantees and we try our best but can only control so much about your success through our courses. You understand that Vanessa Lau makes no guarantees whatsoever regarding any results based on any action or inaction relating to your life, social media accounts or businesses based on the information we share or services we sell or share for free through the Site. At the end of the day, we will not be responsible or make any promises for what will happen in your life and business. Even if you’ve worked with us as client before and had certain results, we make no guarantee that will happen again.

⁣
As enrollment for my signature program @thebossgramacademy closes tonight…⁣
⁣
I want to show you this timeline of events of how I started with the intention of starting a biz in August 2018… to today, August 2020.⁣
⁣
Unlike other coaches who may launch different programs every quarter (and that’s OKAY!)…⁣
⁣
I’ve really stuck with one throughout the life of my business.⁣
⁣
It all started when I worked with my first few beta clients…⁣
⁣
Where I got CLEARER on what I wanted to do.⁣
⁣
Once I got that CLARITY, I started working with clients at the 1:1 level, pay in full…⁣
⁣
Overtime I increased my prices and used that capital I earned to hire people on my team…⁣
⁣
And as demand for my 1:1 coaching grew, I knew that I needed to package all my knowledge that I was giving to my 1:1 clients into a program.⁣
⁣
This is when the FIRST version of @thebossgramacademy was born.⁣
⁣
During this period I made a lot of rookie mistakes, and it was clear to me how my program could be better.⁣
⁣
This is when I niched down so the program would only be suitable for coaches.⁣
⁣
This is when BGA 2.0 was born.⁣
⁣
While being super close to over 1,000 students…⁣
⁣
It eventually became clear to me what the FAQs were, and the existing “gaps” that needed to be filled in the program.⁣
⁣
All of June 2020, I rolled up my sleeves and re-created the entire program.⁣
⁣
Filling every hole.⁣
⁣
Answering every question.⁣
⁣
Deleting anything that wasn’t relevant.⁣
⁣
And adding anything that shouldn’t be missed.⁣
⁣
July 2020 was when BGA 3.0 was born.⁣
⁣
I have poured 2 years of work into this program, and it is the exact reason why we have so many incredible testimonials, advocates, and results produced.⁣
⁣
My biggest advice to new entrepreneurs is to have patience.⁣
⁣
Your first draft will ALWAYS “suck”⁣
⁣
But know that you have TIME to collect data and ALWAYS improve your products and services.⁣
⁣
Start small. Go big. Scale it up.⁣
⁣
📣 TONIGHT is your last chance to enroll and see what @thebossgramacademy has to offer.⁣
⁣
Doors officially close at 11:59PM PST, along with the price, bonuses, and opportunity itself.⁣
⁣
I hope to see you on the inside! ❤️">

I’ll keep this short and sweet, because the carousel speaks for itself.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👉🏼 Doors to The BOSSGRAM Academy closes TOMORROW (8/2) at 11:59PM PST.
⁣⁣
It is the ONLY program I offer. It is my signature program packed with resources I don’t share on my free channels.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I’ve perfected this program to the T with my experience of working with over 1,000+ students.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I’ve combined the knowledge I KNOW will help new coaches PLUS the 6-figure strategies I picked up a long the way.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
People often ask me why I don’t create programs for advanced coaches.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I could...⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But I prefer to help new coaches get a leg up with the RIGHT strategies that don’t keep them stuck for months.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
That’s why when you enroll in BGA, you know you’re getting quality content from someone else who has successfully scaled up their business to 7-figures in 18 months.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
AND scaled to 7 figures within the calendar year.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
(Because yes, there’s a difference between making 7 figures in your lifetime, vs making 7 figures within the calendar year.)⁣⁣
⁣⁣
So, if you want to take advantage of this limited time opportunity, then click the link in bio to learn more about BGA and enroll before the timer hits 0:00.⁣ ⏰

I’ll see you in the program!⁣⁣

⁣
The BEST thing I ever did for my business was to just GO for it.⁣
⁣
Thanks to my corporate background, I learned early on the costly mistake of lacking market validation.⁣
⁣
The # of products that go BUST simply because NO ONE did research to test if it even was going to sell.⁣
⁣
When I worked at L’Oreal, something we did was “Pretotyping”⁣
⁣
The Engineering Director at Google came to speak and taught us the importance of building a quick and cheap version of your product to validate the demand first before you pour resources and money on building the real thing.⁣
⁣
This lesson has been ingrained in me ever since, and is infused in all of my lessons that I teach in my premium program, The BOSSGRAM Academy.
⁣
Because of this, I’ve been able to grow my business fast - even if I didn’t have every check box “ticked” off.⁣
⁣
I was able to validate my offers WHILE scaling up.⁣
⁣
THIS entrepreneurial and fast action spirit is what is missing in a lot of people.⁣
⁣
Heck, it was missing in ME for a very long time….⁣
⁣
UNTIL I learned the importance of it, and continued to practice fast messy action every day.⁣
⁣
It’s a philosophy you need to DEVELOP.⁣
⁣
👉🏼 For those of you eyeing my signature program, The BOSSGRAM Academy, doors are closing this Sunday.⁣
⁣
Inside BGA, my teaching style replicates a lot of the things I learned while working at a billion dollar company.⁣
⁣
The LAST thing I ever want any of my students to do is to waste time and resources on things that won’t sell or be profitable.⁣
⁣
I want my students to think different.⁣
I want my students to be fast to market.⁣
I want my students to win.
⁣
EVEN if they don’t feel “ready”⁣
⁣
Because “ready” doesn’t pay the bills.⁣
⁣
Action does.⁣
⁣
So boss, if you’re ready to join us in the program, you have until Sunday to make your decision AND get our exclusive bonuses available ONLY until this Sunday.⁣
⁣
➡️ Link in bio to enroll. Hope to see you on the inside.

And remember: Perfection is the ENEMY of Profitability. ⁣">

⁣
Over the last few days I’ve gotten a lot of inquiries about The BOSSGRAM Academy…⁣
⁣
Including the reasons why people don’t feel ready to take the next step.⁣
⁣
👉🏼 SWIPE to see the TOP excuses I see most new entrepreneurs make that HINDER their progress.⁣
⁣
These “justifications” aren’t just prevalent in those who are inquiring about BGA…⁣
⁣
But it’s also VERY common amongst my students too, especially when they first join the program.⁣
⁣
That’s why I compiled my answers for each of these misconceptions.⁣
⁣
Remember: The work you’re avoiding is usually the work that you should be doing.⁣
⁣
Take action and start doing the damn thing!⁣
⁣
PS: Enrolment to The BOSSGRAM Academy closes in THREE days. Click the link in my bio to enroll before the timer hits zero this Sunday!⁣

⁣
As enrolment for my signature program @thebossgramacademy closes tonight…⁣
⁣
I want to show you this timeline of events of how I started with the intention of starting a biz in August 2018… to today, August 2020.⁣
⁣
Unlike other coaches who may launch different programs every quarter (and that’s OKAY!)…⁣
⁣
I’ve really stuck with one throughout the life of my business.⁣
⁣
It all started when I worked with my first few beta clients…⁣
⁣
Where I got CLEARER on what I wanted to do.⁣
⁣
Once I got that CLARITY, I started working with clients at the 1:1 level, pay in full…⁣
⁣
Overtime I increased my prices and used that capital I earned to hire people on my team…⁣
⁣
And as demand for my 1:1 coaching grew, I knew that I needed to package all my knowledge that I was giving to my 1:1 clients into a program.⁣
⁣
This is when the FIRST version of @thebossgramacademy was born.⁣
⁣
During this period I made a lot of rookie mistakes, and it was clear to me how my program could be better.⁣
⁣
This is when I niched down so the program would only be suitable for coaches.⁣
⁣
This is when BGA 2.0 was born.⁣
⁣
While being super close to over 1,000 students…⁣
⁣
It eventually became clear to me what the FAQs were, and the existing “gaps” that needed to be filled in the program.⁣
⁣
All of June 2020, I rolled up my sleeves and re-created the entire program.⁣
⁣
Filling every hole.⁣
⁣
Answering every question.⁣
⁣
Deleting anything that wasn’t relevant.⁣
⁣
And adding anything that shouldn’t be missed.⁣
⁣
July 2020 was when BGA 3.0 was born.⁣
⁣
I have poured 2 years of work into this program, and it is the exact reason why we have so many incredible testimonials, advocates, and results produced.⁣
⁣
My biggest advice to new entrepreneurs is to have patience.⁣
⁣
Your first draft will ALWAYS “suck”⁣
⁣
But know that you have TIME to collect data and ALWAYS improve your products and services.⁣
⁣
Start small. Go big. Scale it up.⁣
⁣
📣 TONIGHT is your last chance to enroll and see what @thebossgramacademy has to offer.⁣
⁣
Doors officially close at 11:59PM PST, along with the price, bonuses, and opportunity itself.⁣
⁣
I hope to see you on the inside! ❤️">

👉🏼 Doors to The BOSSGRAM Academy closes TOMORROW (8/2) at 11:59PM PST.
⁣⁣
It is the ONLY program I offer. It is my signature program packed with resources I don’t share on my free channels.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I’ve perfected this program to the T with my experience of working with over 1,000+ students.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I’ve combined the knowledge I KNOW will help new coaches PLUS the 6-figure strategies I picked up a long the way.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
People often ask me why I don’t create programs for advanced coaches.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I could...⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But I prefer to help new coaches get a leg up with the RIGHT strategies that don’t keep them stuck for months.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
That’s why when you enroll in BGA, you know you’re getting quality content from someone else who has successfully scaled up their business to 7-figures in 18 months.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
AND scaled to 7 figures within the calendar year.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
(Because yes, there’s a difference between making 7 figures in your lifetime, vs making 7 figures within the calendar year.)⁣⁣
⁣⁣

⁣
The BEST thing I ever did for my business was to just GO for it.⁣
⁣
Thanks to my corporate background, I learned early on the costly mistake of lacking market validation.⁣
⁣
The # of products that go BUST simply because NO ONE did research to test if it even was going to sell.⁣
⁣
When I worked at L’Oreal, something we did was “Pretotyping”⁣
⁣
The Engineering Director at Google came to speak and taught us the importance of building a quick and cheap version of your product to validate the demand first before you pour resources and money on building the real thing.⁣
⁣
This lesson has been ingrained in me ever since, and is infused in all of my lessons that I teach in my premium program, The BOSSGRAM Academy.
⁣
Because of this, I’ve been able to grow my business fast - even if I didn’t have every check box “ticked” off.⁣
⁣
I was able to validate my offers WHILE scaling up.⁣
⁣
THIS entrepreneurial and fast action spirit is what is missing in a lot of people.⁣
⁣
Heck, it was missing in ME for a very long time….⁣
⁣
UNTIL I learned the importance of it, and continued to practice fast messy action every day.⁣
⁣
It’s a philosophy you need to DEVELOP.⁣
⁣
👉🏼 For those of you eyeing my signature program, The BOSSGRAM Academy, doors are closing this Sunday.⁣
⁣
Inside BGA, my teaching style replicates a lot of the things I learned while working at a billion dollar company.⁣
⁣
The LAST thing I ever want any of my students to do is to waste time and resources on things that won’t sell or be profitable.⁣
⁣
I want my students to think different.⁣
I want my students to be fast to market.⁣
I want my students to win.
⁣
EVEN if they don’t feel “ready”⁣
⁣
Because “ready” doesn’t pay the bills.⁣
⁣
Action does.⁣
⁣
So boss, if you’re ready to join us in the program, you have until Sunday to make your decision AND get our exclusive bonuses available ONLY until this Sunday.⁣
⁣
➡️ Link in bio to enroll. Hope to see you on the inside.

⁣
Over the last few days I’ve gotten a lot of inquiries about The BOSSGRAM Academy…⁣
⁣
Including the reasons why people don’t feel ready to take the next step.⁣
⁣
👉🏼 SWIPE to see the TOP excuses I see most new entrepreneurs make that HINDER their progress.⁣
⁣
These “justifications” aren’t just prevalent in those who are inquiring about BGA…⁣
⁣
But it’s also VERY common amongst my students too, especially when they first join the program.⁣
⁣
That’s why I compiled my answers for each of these misconceptions.⁣
⁣
Remember: The work you’re avoiding is usually the work that you should be doing.⁣
⁣
Take action and start doing the damn thing!⁣
⁣
PS: Enrolment to The BOSSGRAM Academy closes in THREE days. Click the link in my bio to enroll before the timer hits zero this Sunday!⁣

I hope to see you on the inside, action taker!">

⁣⁣⁣
So many times we hear a rags to riches story by entrepreneurs. Why? ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Because not a single entrepreneur HASN&#039;T struggled while they tried making it to the top.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Even for me, most people just think⁣:⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
&quot;Vanessa had a viral video and that&#039;s why she&#039;s successful.&quot;⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
WITHOUT mentioning all the other videos that DIDN&#039;T go viral.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
WITHOUT mentioning that I was actually working as a part time coffee barista working with free clients for 6 months.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
WITHOUT mentioning that before ANYTHING went viral, I was already getting client experience and revving up my skills.
⁣⁣⁣
The truth is...⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
When that video got picked up by the algorithm, I finally got something RIGHT.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
I chose the RIGHT topic.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
I chose the RIGHT time.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
I chose the RIGHT lead magnet to attach to the video.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
I chose the RIGHT videos to follow up that video.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
... I finally got things RIGHT.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Now, you may never know IF or WHEN you have something right...⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
But what matters is that sometimes, all it takes is just being RIGHT that ONE time...⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
That can change your whole entire life.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Failure, NOT getting things right, and missing the mark are probably going to take up a solid 95% of your journey...⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
And while it can take juuuuust that 5% that can actually change your entire career.... it&#039;s really THANKS to the 95% of work you put in to make it happen.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
So, when you&#039;re looking at your favourite entrepreneurs... know that they hit their home runs because out of a sea of failures, they finally got ONE thing right.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
And HOW they GOT to that ONE thing...⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Is that they didn&#039;t give up.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Remember this:⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
“I have not failed, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that don&#039;t work.&quot;⁣⁣⁣

⁣
They “suck” and “don’t work” because you’ve outgrown free Youtube videos.⁣
⁣
Ever notice all YT videos are catered to beginners? Frustrated that it’s all the same stuff?⁣
⁣
The reason Is because it’s ONLY beginners who are on Youtube looking for quick hacks to “grow” their business.⁣
⁣
Experienced business owners, people who are serious about their results…⁣
⁣
They are NOT searching for the “latest” hack they can find on the internet.⁣
⁣
When I want serious results, I don’t turn to Youtube.⁣
⁣
I turn to mentorship.⁣
I turn to paid communities.⁣
I turn to investing in programs that are DESIGNED to get me results⁣
⁣
Not in 20 minutes, but in 3-6 months, because I know that’s what it takes.⁣
⁣
I once invested in a $20,000 program, and made $1,000,000 back.⁣
⁣
My own students have invested in BGA not just make it back but make MUCH MORE back.⁣
⁣
2x ROI, 5x ROI, 10x ROI, 15x ROI⁣
⁣
THESE are the results you get when you put SKIN in the game.⁣
⁣
STOP looking for the next cute “hack” and START investing in long lasting APPLICABLE skills that can make you money anytime.⁣
⁣
You don’t need to know the hack to getting the swipe up feature.⁣
⁣
You need to know the skills to create an offer, package it, position it, sell it.⁣
⁣
The skills to create systems. To tap into sales psychology. To know how to be a LEADER.⁣
⁣
Growing a business takes TIME, and the time passes faster when you get the actual support you need. ⁣
⁣
You don’t know what you don’t know.⁣
⁣
Everything you see on the internet right now is just the TIP of the iceberg of what it takes to build a successful business.⁣
⁣
A 20 minute Youtube video (even mine!) is not enough to cover the vast amount of work and information you need to grow.⁣
⁣
