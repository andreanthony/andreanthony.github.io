## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/andreanthony/andreanthony.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

I’m not a typical engineer. I didn’t go to an Ivy League school, and I didn’t have a path laid out for me as a kid. I didn’t even know what computer engineering was until I went to college. I was pretty good at math and science, so I decided to look into programming and signed up for a few introductory classes. While I loved the work, I didn’t feel like I was learning fast enough, so I started watching YouTube videos about programming and realized the best way for me to get the coding experience I needed was to build something. 

I just want people to know you don’t have to come from a certain background or look a certain way—you just have to be curious and you have to be prepared to work hard.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/andreanthony/andreanthony.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
